          <ul>
            <li>Thesis Abstract: This thesis aims at introducing a model for automatic disfluency detection in spontaneous speech transcripts called the LSTM Noisy Channel Model. The model uses a noisy channel model to find "rough copies" that are likely to indicate disfluencies and generate <i>n<\i>-best candidate disfluency analyses. Then, the underlying fluent sentences of each candidate analysis are scored using a long short-term memory language model. The LSTM language model scores, along with other features, are used in a maximum entropy reranker to identify the most plausible analysis. We show that using an LSTM language model score as a feature to rerank the analyses generated by a noisy channel disfluency model improves the state-of-the-art in disfluency detection.</li>

          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Thesis Abstract: This thesis aims at developing two independent models for automatic recognition and annotation of prosodic events (including pitch accent and boundary tone) in Persian speech and text. The first model, called the acoustic model, is a continuous Hidden Markov  Model (HMM) which predicts prosodic events from acoustic observations (including various parameters of F0, F1, F2, F3, intensity and duration)  available in speech. The second model, called syntactic model, extracts the syntactic information (such as POS tags, boundary and type of syntactic phrases) of sentence to determine the prosodic events in text according to the Head Avoidance Principle (HAP). In both models, the location and type of pitch accent and boundary tone is determined under ToBI framework. The results of this study can be applied in TTS systems.</li>
