      I am a final year PhD candidate in the <b><a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/about/about-the-university/faculties-and-departments/faculty-of-science-and-engineering/departments-and-centres/department-of-computing" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>Department of Computing </a></b>
      at Macquarie University, supervised by  <b><a href="http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~mjohnson/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>Prof. Mark Johnson</a></b>. My research interests include natural language processing, deep learning and machine learning in general and disfluency detection systems in particular. Currently,
I focus on using state-of-the-art deep neural techniques for representation learning, semi-supervised learning, multi-task learning, as well as developing end-to-end
systems.
